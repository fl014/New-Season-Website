	<h2>What's our story? </h2>
	 
	<p class="space2">David Flores first started landcaping about 30 years ago. He was always loved by all of the clinets due to his hard work, kindness, and lastley his dedication. After working for a company for about 30 years he decided it was time for him to do it on his own. Thats why he started New Season's landcaping and we hope you will join us in a journey of being the best out there. </p>
